# WW2_vis_project

The project visualizes WW2 data, available on Kaggle.
My idea was to find feasible correlation of weather station data and significant events on European theater in 1940-45. However, putting the stations on map showed, that they were located exclusively on shores. That led to an important conclusion that in fact the weather stations did not control the sky and air strikes, they controlled the sea - and predicted the possible route amendments.
My next finding was that there were none German stations in the data set. Perhaps, the stations didn't survive throughout the war, however, I was able to discover a few nazi weather ships. The most significant are mapped, with their final routes. 
Also, my map features the secret German stations, discovered in recent years. Germany posessed 14 stations located around the Polar Circle, 10 of them were to observe the USSR, and 4 - for the US.

It was an exciting project.
